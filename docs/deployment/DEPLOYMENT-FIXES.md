# Deployment Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Signup Database Error (500 Error)
**Problem**: Users were getting "Database error saving new user" when trying to sign up.

**Root Cause**: The `handle_new_user()` trigger was expecting different field names than what the signup API was sending. The API sends `referralCode` but the trigger expected `referred_by`.

**Solution**: 
- Updated `fix-signup-trigger.sql` to handle both field name formats
- Made the trigger more resilient with proper error handling
- Added support for JSON array parsing for interests field
- Fixed referral tracking to look up users by referral code

**Files Changed**:
- `/home/vboxuser/Documents/website/fix-signup-trigger.sql` (created)
- Database trigger `handle_new_user()` needs to be updated in production

### 2. Email Sending Configuration
**Status**: Email service is properly configured with Resend API.

**Configuration**:
- Resend API key is present in `.env.local`
- Email templates are properly set up in both:
  - `/src/services/email.ts` (original service)
  - `/src/services/email-templates.ts` (beautiful templates)
- Welcome emails will be sent automatically on signup

### 3. Demo App Thumbnail Display
**Problem**: Demo app iframe thumbnail may not load properly in production due to CORS or security restrictions.

**Solution**:
- Updated `DemoPreview.tsx` to support both static image and iframe fallback
- Added loading state with spinner
- Created script to capture demo screenshot: `capture-demo-screenshot.js`
- Improved error handling with automatic fallback

**Files Changed**:
- `/src/components/dashboard/DemoPreview.tsx` (updated)
- `/capture-demo-screenshot.js` (created)

### 4. Plaid Partnership Announcement
**Completed**: Added prominent Plaid partnership announcement to dashboard.

**Features Added**:
- Eye-catching announcement with gradient text and special styling
- "NEW" badge with animation
- Additional context box explaining the impact
- Highlighted border and special treatment for partnership announcements

**Files Changed**:
- `/src/pages/DashboardPage.jsx` (updated productUpdates array and rendering)

## Deployment Steps

1. **Apply Database Fix**:
   ```bash
   # Run the SQL fix on your Supabase database
   # Option 1: Use Supabase Dashboard SQL Editor
   # Option 2: Use the provided script
   ./run-signup-fix.sh
   ```

2. **Generate Demo Screenshot** (optional):
   ```bash
   # If you want a static screenshot instead of iframe
   node capture-demo-screenshot.js
   ```

3. **Deploy to Production**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run deploy
   ```

## Verification Steps

1. **Test Signup**:
   - Try creating a new account
   - Verify email is sent
   - Check that user appears in Supabase dashboard

2. **Check Dashboard**:
   - Verify Plaid announcement appears with special styling
   - Confirm demo preview loads (either as image or iframe)
   - Test referral system functionality

3. **Monitor Logs**:
   - Check Supabase logs for any database errors
   - Monitor Resend dashboard for email delivery status

## Important Notes

- The database migration must be run before deployments
- Ensure all environment variables are set in production
- The demo URL may need to be updated if it changes
- Consider adding a static screenshot for better production reliability
