# ðŸš¨ URGENT: Fix Database Issues NOW

Your signup is broken because the `public.users` table is not properly configured. Follow these steps IMMEDIATELY:

## Step 1: Apply Database Fix (2 minutes)

1. Open https://app.supabase.com
2. Go to your project
3. Click **SQL Editor**
4. Click **New query**
5. Copy ALL contents from `docs/database/FIX-DATABASE-NOW.sql`
6. Paste and click **RUN**
7. You should see "Success. No rows returned"

## Step 2: Verify Fix

Test signup immediately:
1. Go to your website
2. Create a new account
3. It should work without errors

## What This Fixes:

âœ… **406 Error** - RLS policies now allow users to read their data
âœ… **Missing Users** - Creates proper users table with all columns
âœ… **Sync Issues** - Syncs existing auth users to public.users
âœ… **Referral System** - Properly handles referral codes
âœ… **Audit Logs** - Creates audit_logs table with proper permissions

## File Organization:

I've organized your project:
- `scripts/` - All shell scripts
- `docs/database/` - Database SQL files
- `docs/deployment/` - Deployment documentation

## If Still Having Issues:

Check in Supabase Dashboard:
1. **Table Editor** â†’ Verify `users` table exists with data
2. **Authentication** â†’ Check if users exist in auth.users
3. **Logs** â†’ Look for any errors

The key issue was that your `public.users` table was either missing or had incorrect RLS policies, preventing the app from reading user data after authentication.
