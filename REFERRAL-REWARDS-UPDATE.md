# Referral Rewards System - Complete Update

## Overview
The referral system has been updated to show detailed progress towards free months and calculate reward tiers based on average subscription values.

## What's New

### 1. Progress Tracking
- Shows exact progress towards next free month (e.g., 3/5 referrals)
- Visual progress bar with percentage
- Tracks completed reward batches

### 2. Tier-Based Rewards
The system now calculates which tier of free month you'll receive based on the average subscription value of your paying referrals:

- **Average < $20**: Free tier reward
- **Average $20-34**: Pro Navigator tier reward ($20 value)
- **Average $35-98**: Family Navigator tier reward ($35 value)  
- **Average $99+**: AI Navigator+ tier reward ($99 value)

### 3. Enhanced Dashboard Display

#### Main Statistics
- Total Referrals
- Waitlist Referrals (not yet paying)
- Paying Customers

#### Potential Revenue Section (for waitlist referrals)
- Number of potential paying users
- Estimated monthly revenue when app launches
- Breakdown by tier preference

#### Reward Progress Section
- Current batch progress (e.g., 3/5 towards next reward)
- Projected reward tier based on current batch
- Average subscription value of current batch
- Completed batches notification

### 4. How It Works

1. **Referral Requirements**:
   - Pilot members: 5 paying referrals = 1 free month
   - Waitlist members: 10 paying referrals = 1 free month
   - Regular members: 20 paying referrals = 1 free month

2. **Reward Calculation**:
   - System tracks the subscription tier of each paying referral
   - Calculates average subscription value
   - Awards free month at the appropriate tier level

3. **Example**:
   - You refer 5 people (as a pilot member)
   - 2 choose Pro ($20), 2 choose Family ($35), 1 chooses AI ($99)
   - Average value: ($20+$20+$35+$35+$99)/5 = $41.80
   - You receive 1 month of Family Navigator free ($35 value)

## Database Updates Complete
