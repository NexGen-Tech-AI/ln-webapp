# CI/CD Setup Complete for Hostinger

Your CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment to Hostinger is now fully configured!

## What's Been Set Up

### 1. Production Deployment (`/.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)
- **VPS Deployment**: Automatic deployment via SSH to Hostinger VPS
- **FTP Deployment**: Alternative deployment via FTP (manual trigger)
- **Triggers**: Pushes to `main`/`master` branch
- **Features**:
  - Automated testing before deployment
  - Health checks after deployment
  - Automatic backups with rollback capability
  - Database migration support
  - PM2 process management

### 2. Staging Environment (`/.github/workflows/staging.yml`)
- **Preview Deployments**: Vercel previews for pull requests
- **Staging VPS**: Separate staging environment deployment
- **Triggers**: 
  - PRs to main branch (preview)
  - Pushes to `develop`/`staging` branches (staging deploy)

### 3. Rollback Capability (`/.github/workflows/rollback.yml`)
- **Manual Rollback**: Restore previous deployments
- **Environment Selection**: Production or staging
- **Backup Management**: Automatic backup retention

### 4. Deployment Scripts
- **SSH Deployment**: `/scripts/deploy-hostinger.sh`
- **Build Script**: `/deploy-hostinger.sh`

## Next Steps

### 1. Configure GitHub Secrets
Add these secrets in your GitHub repository settings:

**Production VPS:**
- `HOSTINGER_HOST`
- `HOSTINGER_USER`
- `HOSTINGER_SSH_KEY`
- `HOSTINGER_SSH_PORT`

**Application Secrets:**
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- All other secrets listed in `/docs/github-secrets-setup.md`

### 2. Test the Pipeline
1. Create a test branch: `git checkout -b test/ci-cd`
2. Make a small change
3. Push and create a PR to see preview deployment
4. Merge to trigger production deployment

### 3. Manual Deployment Options
- **Via GitHub Actions**: Go to Actions tab → Deploy to Hostinger → Run workflow
- **Via CLI**: `bash scripts/deploy-hostinger.sh`

## Deployment Flow

```
Push to main → Tests → Build → Deploy to VPS → Health Check → Success
     ↓ (if fails)
Automatic retention of previous version for rollback
```

## Important Notes

1. **SSH Key Setup**: Generate and add SSH keys as described in the secrets documentation
2. **PM2 Setup**: Ensure PM2 is installed on your VPS
3. **Nginx Config**: Configure reverse proxy on VPS (see HOSTINGER-VPS-DEPLOYMENT.md)
4. **Database**: Migrations run automatically during deployment

The CI/CD pipeline is production-ready and includes all best practices for reliable deployments!
