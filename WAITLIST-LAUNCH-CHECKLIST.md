# 🚀 Waitlist App - Launch Today Checklist

## What This Actually Is:
A **FREE waitlist landing page** to collect interested users while you build the real product.

## What Actually Matters for a Waitlist:

### ✅ Already Working:
1. **User Signup** - People can join the waitlist
2. **Email Collection** - Capturing user data
3. **Referral System** - Users can share and move up
4. **Welcome Emails** - Beautiful templates ready
5. **Dashboard** - Users can see their position

### 🔧 Quick Fixes Needed (1-2 hours):

#### 1. Apply Database Migrations (30 min)
```bash
# Go to Supabase Dashboard > SQL Editor
# Run each migration file in order:
1. fix_signup_trigger.sql
2. analytics_schema.sql  
3. add_referral_rewards_system.sql
4. complete_database_optimization.sql
```

#### 2. Fix Email Verification (30 min)
The verification token is already in the migration. Just need to test the flow works.

#### 3. Add Basic Security Headers (15 min)
Create minimal middleware:
```typescript
// middleware.ts
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export function middleware(request) {
  const response = NextResponse.next()
  
  // Basic security headers
  response.headers.set('X-Frame-Options', 'DENY')
  response.headers.set('X-Content-Type-Options', 'nosniff')
  
  return response
}
```

#### 4. Set Production URLs (5 min)
```env
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-generated-secret-here
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://lifenav.ai
```

### ❌ What to IGNORE for Waitlist:

1. **Stripe/Payments** - Not needed, it's free!
2. **ID.me Verification** - Not needed yet
3. **Complex Security** - Basic is fine for waitlist
4. **Load Testing** - Unlikely to get 10k users day 1
